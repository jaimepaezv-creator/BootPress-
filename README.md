# BootPress Ultra

**The "Code-First" Visual Builder for WordPress based on Bootstrap 5.3.**

BootPress Ultra replaces the default Gutenberg editor with a high-performance visual environment powered by **GrapesJS** and **Monaco Editor**. It is designed specifically for developers who demand clean HTML output, **Picostrap** integration, and zero "shortcode lock-in."

## 🚀 Key Features

- **GrapesJS Engine:** Full drag-and-drop capability using native Bootstrap 5.3 components (Rows, Cols, Cards, Modals).
- **Monaco Editor Integration:** VS Code-like experience inside WordPress. Edit HTML/CSS in real-time with bi-directional syncing to the canvas.
- **Picostrap Native Sync:** Automatically detects the active **Picostrap** theme and injects the compiled CSS (with Customizer variables) into the editor canvas.
- **Pure HTML Output:** No shortcodes for layout. Content is saved as clean, standard HTML5.
- **`wpautop` Killer:** Intelligent filtering prevents WordPress from injecting `<p>` tags into your Bootstrap layout.
- **Dual-Layer Persistence:**
  - `post_content`: Stores the static HTML/CSS (SEO ready, fast loading).
  - `_bootpress_json`: Stores the GrapesJS state object (Editable layers).

## 📦 Installation (Development)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/bootpress-ultra.git
   cd bootpress-ultra
   ```

2. **Install PHP Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Install JS Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Build Assets:**
   ```bash
   # For development (watch mode)
   npm start

   # For production (minified)
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Activate:** Go to WordPress Plugins and activate **BootPress Ultra**.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Usage

### 1. The Canvas
The editor runs in an isolated Iframe. It automatically dequeues standard WP admin styles to prevent conflicts.

### 2. Picostrap Integration
Ensure your active theme is a child of **Picostrap**. The plugin looks for the compiled CSS path generated by the theme's SCSS compiler.
*   *If Picostrap is detected:* The editor uses the theme's CSS.
*   *If not detected:* The editor falls back to the standard Bootstrap 5.3 CDN.

### 3. Rendering Logic
Shortcodes for layout are **forbidden**.
- **Layout:** Saved as pure HTML.
- **Dynamic Content:** Use the "Shortcode Block" in GrapesJS. This fetches a server-side render of the shortcode (e.g., Contact Form 7) for preview.
